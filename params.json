{"name":"Plex for Alexa","tagline":"Alexa Skill for interacting with your Plex Media Server and Plex players.","body":"### Usage\r\n> \"Alexa, ask the home theater what's on deck?\"\r\n\r\n> \"Alexa, tell the home theater to put on Always Sunny\"\r\n\r\n> \"Alexa, tell the home theater to put on episode 3 of Band of Brothers\"\r\n\r\n> \"Alexa, tell the home theater to put on Adventure Time, and make it a good one!\"\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\nCurrently, Plex for Alexa does not have the ability to customize which server and which player you are using. It works best if you have a single Plex server connected to a single player (servers shared with you are ignored currently, so you don't have to worry about them.)\r\n\r\nThe ability to use multiple servers at the same time as well as casting to any number of players is currently under development.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\nRight now playback commands have only been tested with the following clients:\r\n\r\n* Plex Home Theater\r\n\r\nIf you have other players and would like to help out with testing, please join the [Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/OverloadUT/alexa-plex)","google":"UA-72210331-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
